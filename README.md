In the initial release, copy and paste flight plans from the flight-plan channel in the discord and paste it into the box. Then after you click the Auto paste flight button It will automatically add it to the list.

You can edit each flight (or re-upload it to change the auto-generated squawk code.)
All emergency codes such as 7500, 7600, and 7700 cannot be generated but all VFR flights automatically set the squawk to 1200.

Example of a flight plan:

Username: @username1
Callsign: UAE1219
Aircraft: B77W
Flight Rules: IFR
Departing: IRFD
Arriving: ITKO
Route: GPS Direct
Flight Level: 050

This is all public code, you may edit it and customize it or add to it (after you credit me in the code.)
Please do not sell, redistribute or otherwise edit the code for malicious intent, you can either download the .exe (which might piss off your antivirus) or manually run the source code .py in Visual Studio Code.
