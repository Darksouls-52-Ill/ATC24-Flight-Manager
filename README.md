In the initial release, copy flight plans from the flight-plan channel in the Discord and paste it into the box. Then, after you click the Auto paste flight button, it will automatically add the flight to the list.

You can edit each flight (or re-upload it to change the auto-generated squawk code.)
All emergency codes such as 7500, 7600, and 7700 cannot be generated but all VFR flights automatically set the squawk to 1200.

This is all public code, you may edit it and customize it or add to it (after you credit me in the code.)
Please do not sell, redistribute or otherwise edit the code for malicious intent, you can either download the .exe (which might piss off your antivirus) or manually run the source code .py in Visual Studio Code. 
Go  to the releases tab on the right side in the Github and download the .exe.
